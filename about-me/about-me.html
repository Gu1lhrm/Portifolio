        <p style="color: black; padding-top: 5%;">My name is Guilherme Mendes, but most of the people around me just call me Gui, or baiano - because of where I was born, Bahia. Even though I love to live in Brazil and love everything about the Brazilian culture, I always had the desire to live abroad. I believe that by going abroad to study I can enhance my knowledge and personal abilities, so I can help as many people as I can back in Brazil. I was able to live outside of my country for 6 months in 2017, where I lived in Toronto, Canada. I had 12 years old at the time, yet I was able to enjoy and learn a lot from the experience. I like to spend my free time playing video games and sports, as well as studying areas that I have an interest in - such as programming languages, and math. I look forward to doing my undergraduate years in Canada studying either Computer Science or Software Engineering, and after that, work on a job where I can help other people that didn't have the same opportunities as I did.
